I'm __Greg__, a {{< age-from-now >}} years old engineer specialized in video games development.   
I had the chance to work, during my career, on several titles like {{< personal-projects >}} and some others unannonced titles.

To be honest with you, I'm not that guy who starting programming when he was little. In fact, my "real" first programming experience was back in 2013, and I had 18 years old back then.

But my __curiousity__ and my __hard working__ allows me to quickly catch up. And since then, I'm enjoying my journey, by learning new things everyday, in the wide world of computer science. 

Like Master Yi, a League of Legends Champion, summarize well:

> A true master is an eternal student. 

Keep on learning folks :book: :heart:
