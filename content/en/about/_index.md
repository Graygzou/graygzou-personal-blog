I'm Greg, a {{< age-from-now >}} years old engineer.
Computer science let you create what you want.
Creations is limitless !


To be honest, I'm not the guy that was passionnated since his young age about computer science at all. 
My first contact with this wonderful world was back in 2013. I was 18 years old.

Since then, I followed my path guided by this thirst of learning new things in this wide field.

The desire of working in Video Games came as a surprised. I had a Nintendo 64 when I was little, played Pokemon Blue on GameBoy and also some Ubisoft title like Rayman. But I never expected to work on games at that time (because I didn't wanted to work at all maybe..)

I had the chance to work on a wide variety on titles like Cuphead: Don't Deal With The Devil, F1 Mobile Racing and some others unannonced titles.

Enjoy what live give you :tada:
