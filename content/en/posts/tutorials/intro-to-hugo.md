I wanted to setyp an asset pipeline. I did not do it for jekyll and found (too late) repos like this one [jekyll-assets](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-assets).

So I had to take a look at [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) first.
Modules are a way to split the code over multiples files. Like includes.

/!\ Download the extended version of hugo !
This will allows to use assets pipeline and use resources.ToCSS for example (assets will be generated into resources/_gen/)
