## Default theme
Jekyll as the minimal theme embeded by default. which is quite simple and nice. Compared to hugo which shipped with nothing.
Having a "small" default theme is nice to start customizating it to make your own one. Compare to hugo which you can't really start from a "ready to ship" theme. Harder to customize so better to start with nothing or start with theme that match your needs.

But hugo has the Ananke theme when settings it up. It's small enough to learn a lot from it. I guess we can say it's even on that point.

## Programming language
jekyll => use Liquid (link). closer to an actual programming language with {{}} for variable {%--%} for statements and statements closer than actual languages known

hugo on the other hand, hugo use ... . It write all with {{}} and use "hongarian" notation for if statement.

## Menu
hugo has his own menu system.

## Content
Follow same logic. All markdown with front matters and can be populate to customize the page. Hugo support more option (toml and ...) so i guess hugo is more versatile on that.

## Documentation
Hugo has some nice documentation and also feature youtube videos. For people who prefer video youtube this is really nice.
Jekyll documentation is not bad but could be improved I guess. (some information are repeated and some other are a bit hidden. Also searching on the documentation isn't straight forward compared to hugo.)

## Github integration
Jekyll is better ?


## Whitespaces problem ?
Use {{- -}} Instead of {{ }}. Life saver.
